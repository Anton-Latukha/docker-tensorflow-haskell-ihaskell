iHaskell

Tensorflow

Stanford CoreNLP

## Image Description:

I need a convenient Docker image that would contain both installation of latest iHaskell, Haskell bindings to TensorFlow, and SyntaxNet.

I may rehire consultant when they will both need update.

References:
* SyntaxNet:
https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet
Relevant Docker image: tensorflow/syntaxnet
* iHaskell:
https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell
Relevant Docker image: gibiansky/ihaskell
* Haskell bindings for TensorFlow:
https://github.com/tensorflow/haskell
https://github.com/TaktInc/tensorflow-haskell

To be published as open source.

### Milestones
Tensorflow working in iHaskell image over 8888
